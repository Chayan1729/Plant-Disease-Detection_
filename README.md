# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection

This is a **Streamlit-based web application** that uses a trained deep learning model to detect plant diseases from leaf images. The model identifies both the plant and its disease with high confidence.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Upload plant leaf images through a simple drag-and-drop interface.
- **Wide Disease Coverage**: Detects 38 plant diseases, including healthy plant states.
- **Interactive Analysis**: Provides confidence scores and disease-specific information.
- **Real-time Results**: Processes and predicts disease in seconds.
